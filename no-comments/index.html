  This blog does not offer a commenting form. That is intentional. Though, I&#39;m not against useful feedback and constructive criticism.
</p>

<p>
  If you do have something to say, pause first and give it some thought.
</p>

<p>
Should you decide to proceed, <a href="https://twitter.com/razvancaliman">send me a tweet</a> or consider making a <a href="https://github.com/oslego/oslego.github.com/tree/authoring/src/writing">pull request on my content</a> if you have something valuable to add. Your contributions will be rightly recognized and I will appreciate your thoughtfulness.
</p>

<h2>
Why no comments?
</h2>

<p>
I find commenting systems to be painful to moderate, a drag on my time, energy and mental resources. Most comments I encounter on the web are off-topic, congratulatory (flattering, though essentially useless to others), spam or lazy gibberish.
</p>

<p>
The occasional golden nuggets of insight get drowned under all this cruft. This insight should be promoted into the article for the benefit of all future readers.
</p>

<p>
Commenting forms are not built for debate and they are certainly not built for collaboration. That&#39;s why I favor using <a href="https://github.com/oslego/oslego.github.com">GitHub</a> to create, maintain and publish my content.
</p>

<p>
If you have knowledge to add, I welcome your contributions.
</p>

<h2>
But how do I thank you?
</h2>

<p>
Think happy thoughts and do something nice for someone else. I&#39;ll know.
