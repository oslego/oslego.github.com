# Enjoy your privacy

<div id="post">

I'm mindful of my online privacy and I endeavor to protect yours too.

This website does not track your activity. There is no analytics service behind it, no tracking cookies, and no social plugins to fingerprint you. There is a single cookie, `__cfduid`, issued by CloudFlare, a service I use for its DNS mapping feature. They promise that it is [not used for tracking](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-CloudFlare-cfduid-cookie-do-).

This is a place where I write some thoughts, which I believe to be genuinely useful. I'm thankful that you're reading these lines. For that, I don't need to know who you are, where you're from, what you do, as long as you ... _insert cheesy [nineties pop song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gl2QnHNpkA) here_. :)

Enjoy your online privacy.
