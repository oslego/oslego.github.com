<div id="post">

<p>I&#39;m not keen on job titles, but, for easy reference, you can put me in the web developer bucket. As a free-range web developer at <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a>, I get a lot of flexibility to work on various cutting-edge tools and web technologies. I thrive in environments where I have the autonomy to pick the right solutions, explore and learn.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I enjoy working with JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build effective solutions to real problems. While I prefer client-side web development, I do not shy away from meddling on the server-side.Ã‚</p>
<p>Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/razvancaliman">@razvancaliman</a> if you want to know what grabs my attention from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="adobe">Adobe</h2>
<p>I work with a bunch of smart people at Adobe, on the Web Platform team, teaching CSS new tricks. We&#39;re building CSS Regions, CSS Shapes and Exclusions, CSS Shaders and more.  Keep an eye on us at <a href="http://html.adobe.com">html.adobe.com</a></p>
<p>I put myself through some pain so you don&#39;t have to. I often work with <em>not-quite-done-yet</em> technology in order to uncover bugs and workflows that can be improved. I build JavaScript prototypes to quickly validate ideas and I provide feedback and use cases for web standards proposals.</p>
<h2 id="curious-by-nature">Curious by nature</h2>
<p>I break a lot of things to understand what makes them tick. That&#39;s how I learn best.</p>
<p>I have an attitude towards reducing needless complexity and I believe elegant simple solutions work best in solving real problems.</p>
