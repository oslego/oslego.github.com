This is the source for my [personal blog](http://razvancaliman.com).

It's a static website, custom generated from Markdown. The work happens in [Gruntfile.js](Gruntfile.js).

A comment form is not available. If you have something to say, [tweet me](https://twitter.com/razvancaliman/) or [file an issue](https://github.com/oslego/oslego.github.com/issues).

The default branch is `authoring`. The `master` branch contains only the build output, which gets automatically overwritten, and it is used by GitHub to deliver the website.
